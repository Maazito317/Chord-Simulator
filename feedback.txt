Hello Team,

Your project is graded.


You have simulated users through random requests to the system invoking your own exposed APIs on the movies data.
You have nicely used an user actor performing the above using your Node registry.

Could have implemented individual actors for each entity of the CHORD and performed finger table look up for the simulation.

Your grades are updated on BB(You will access them when they are released).

Regards,
Mohammed Siddiq
